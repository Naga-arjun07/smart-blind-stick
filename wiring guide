### ðŸ”Œ **Wiring Instructions**

| Component            | Arduino Pin         | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HC-SR04 VCC**       | 5V                  | Powers the ultrasonic sensor                                          |
| **HC-SR04 GND**       | GND                 | Connect to Arduino GND                                                |
| **HC-SR04 Trig**      | Digital Pin 9       | Sends the ultrasonic pulse                                            |
| **HC-SR04 Echo**      | Digital Pin 10      | Receives the reflected pulse                                          |
| **LED Anode (+)**     | Digital Pin 6       | Use a 220Î© resistor in series                                         |
| **LED Cathode (â€“)**   | GND                 | Connect to Arduino GND                                                |
| **Buzzer +**          | Digital Pin 7       | Active buzzers work best for simple tone                             |
| **Buzzer â€“**          | GND                 | Connect to Arduino GND                                                |
| **9V Battery +**      | VIN or DC Jack      | Supplies power to the Arduino Uno                                     |
| **9V Battery â€“**      | GND                 | Common ground with Arduino                                            |

### ðŸ§  **How It Works**
- The **ultrasonic sensor** detects obstacles by sending out sound waves and measuring the time it takes for them to bounce back.
- If an object is detected within a certain range (e.g., < 50 cm), the **LED lights up** and the **buzzer sounds** to alert the user.

### âœ… **Optional Enhancements**
- Add a **vibration motor** for tactile feedback.
- Use a **rechargeable battery** with a charging module.
- Integrate a **Bluetooth module** for remote monitoring.
